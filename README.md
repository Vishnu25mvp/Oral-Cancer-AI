# 🚀 How to Run React App (Simple Guide)

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

In your React project folder (where `package.json` exists), run:

```bash
npm install
```

or shorter:

```bash
npm i
```

✅ This installs all the required node modules listed in `package.json`.

---

### 2️⃣ Run the development server

After installation finishes, start the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or, if you’re using **Create React App**, then use:

```bash
npm start
```

---

### 3️⃣ Open your browser

Once it compiles successfully, open:
👉 **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

Your React app should now be running live and automatically reload on save.

---

### 4️⃣ (Optional) Stop the server

Press **Ctrl + C** in your terminal to stop the development server.

---

✅ That’s it!

* `npm i` → install all packages
* `npm run dev` (or `npm start`) → run the React app locally
